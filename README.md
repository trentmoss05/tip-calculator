# tip-calculator

This is a simple Tip Calculator that I created that uses just basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. Relatively simple to use, just go to the webpage, enter in the bill total, quality of service (determines the size of the tip), and the number of people sharing the bill. Hit calculate and the tip amount is calculated and displayed on the page.
